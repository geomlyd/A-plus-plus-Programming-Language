# Overview

A C++ implementation of an interpreter for the A++ Programming Language (variant of [Delta](https://projects.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html)). 
Developed as the main project of the graduate course [https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy540/description.html]("Advanced Topics in Programming Languages Development") (Department of Computer Science, University of Crete), by [https://github.com/manosgior](Emmanouil Giortamis), [https://github.com/AlivasGR](Anastasios Livanidis) and [https://github.com/geomlyd](Georgios Lydakis).

The project showcases metaprogramming capabilities including runtime code modifications and dynamic execution of code strings, along with a fully functional visual debugger with a simple interface.
