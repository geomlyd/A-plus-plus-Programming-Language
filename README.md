A++ Programming Language based on Delta (https://projects.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html), implemented as an interpreted language in C++. 
It was created as the main project of the graduate course CS-540 (Advanced Topics in Programming Languages Development) project: https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy540/description.html

The language is basically the Alpha language developed in https://github.com/manosgior/Alpha-Programming-Language, but modified to be interpreted and also support metaprogramming features, such as the ability to change the source code at runtime and parse strings into executable code. It also features a
simple debugger.

The team consisted of three members (Emmanouil Giortamis https://github.com/manosgior, Georgios Lydakis https://github.com/geomlyd and Anastasios Livanidis https://github.com/AlivasGR) and the work was more or less equally distributed. This repo is a public read-only copy of the original, created for showcasing examples of our work for CV purposes.
