A++ Programming Language based on Delta (https://projects.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html) implemented in C++. 
It was created for the purpose of CS-540's (Advanced Topics in Programming Languages Development) project: https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy540/description.html
Originally there were 2 more collaborators in a private repository but i made this public copy for CV purposes (thus the work shown here is roughly 1/3 mine).
