# Overview

A C++ implementation of an interpreter for the A++ Programming Language (variant of [Delta](https://projects.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html)). 
Developed as the main project of the graduate course ["Advanced Topics in Programming Language Development"](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy540/description.html) (Department of Computer Science, University of Crete), by [Emmanouil Giortamis](https://github.com/manosgior), [Anastasios Livanidis](https://github.com/AlivasGR) and [Georgios Lydakis](https://github.com/geomlyd).

The project showcases metaprogramming capabilities including runtime code modifications and dynamic execution of code strings, along with a fully functional visual debugger with a simple interface.
